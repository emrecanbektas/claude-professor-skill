## 🧠 What is this?

`claude-professor-skill` is a **plug-and-play Claude skill** that activates a full university professor persona inside Claude. It is built for students, self-learners, and educators who want AI-powered studying that goes far beyond simple Q&A.

Once activated with the keyword **`lecture me`**, Claude becomes a domain-expert professor capable of:

- 📚 Teaching structured lectures with real academic depth
- 📝 Generating and grading full exams (midterm & final)
- 🔮 Predicting high-probability exam topics
- 💪 Running adaptive practice sessions targeting your weak areas

This is not a generic chatbot prompt. It is a **structured, stateful, interaction-driven skill** with a strict MCQ widget system, memory tracking, and a star-based exam importance rating system.

## ✨ Features

### 🎯 4 Core Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Lecture Mode** | Professor-style teaching with concept → intuition → example → common mistakes. Ends with MCQ generation. |
| **2. Exam Mode** | Full midterm or final simulation. No answers revealed until full submission. Strict grading. |
| **3. Prediction Mode** | AI identifies high/medium/low probability exam topics using the ⭐ system. |
| **4. Practice Mode** | Adaptive exercises starting easy → hard. Focuses on your weak areas automatically. |

---

### ⭐ Exam Importance Rating System

Every concept is labeled with exam probability so you study smarter:

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ⭐ | Low probability — good to know |
| ⭐⭐ | Medium probability — study this |
| ⭐⭐⭐ | **HIGH probability — very likely on exams** |

Concepts rated ⭐⭐⭐ are explicitly flagged: *"This concept is very likely to appear in exams."*

### 📊 Interactive MCQ Widget System

All multiple-choice questions follow a strict interactive format:

- **Selectable A/B/C/D buttons** — click to answer
- **Immediate color-coded feedback** — ✅ green for correct, ❌ red for incorrect
- **Professor-level explanations** after every answer
- **Previous / Next navigation buttons**
- **Next Question locked** until you answer (no skipping)
- **Full score tracking** and final grade

  Here's what it looks like in action:

  The widget highlights your selection in red if wrong and the correct answer in green, followed by a detailed professor-level explanation — instantly, before you move on.

### 🧠 Memory & Weakness Tracking System

The professor tracks your performance internally across the session:

| Status | Condition |
|--------|-----------|
| ✅ Strong Topic | Consistently correct answers |
| ⚠️ Weak Topic | Wrong answer recorded |
| 🚨 Critical Weak Area | Repeated mistakes on same concept |

Weak areas are **automatically revisited** and flagged: *"This is one of your weak areas — we need to reinforce it."*
